- 👋 Hi, I’m @88wasgreat
- 👀 I’m interested in getting coding work that involves basic Java programming skills (loops, arrays, if/else statements).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java.  I am concentrating on preparing for the Java 8.0 IZ0-808 exam and at the same time trying to understand servlets.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on work that will help build my e-commerce skills.
- 📫 I can be reached through Github.
